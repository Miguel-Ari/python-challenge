# python-challenge

I had some issues cloning my repository to my computer.
However, I have included all relevant files required for grading.

You will find the python script, csv source file and output text file
for both the PyBank and PyPoll problems.

python script prints the results to the terminal as well as creating
an output text file with the results.

Let me know if you have any prblem to open the files.
